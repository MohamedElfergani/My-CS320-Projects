	The most suitable programming paradigm I liked is Object Oriented Programming (OOP) because we have the ability to use real world problems in code. It also allows us to hide implementations from clients, which is a unique quality to have in a programming paradigm. The most language I felt comfortable using is C++. Since it is one of the first languages I learned, C++ allows us to have a lot of control, it is fast, and powerful. For example, C++ is compiled to binaries, so it runs much faster than Java and many other programming languages.
